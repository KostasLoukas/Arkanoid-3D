# Arkanoid 3D
This simple Arkanoid game simulates the excitement of breaking bricks but in a 3D environment.
The project was developed using the C++ language and the OpenGL library. To run it, you'll need to go
to the SArkanoid\dist\Windows_Debug\MinGW-Windows directory and run the arkanoid.exe file. The game has
no sound.

Controls:
- WASD to move your platform up, right, down and left.
- Hold E for automatic platform movement that follows the ball's X and Y axes (cheat).
- Press 1, 2, 3 for alternative view points of the 3D environment.
